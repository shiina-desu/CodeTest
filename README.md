# CodeTest

The code to refactor was good. Its comprehensive.
The oneliner code are neat to see. There are just quite a
lot of commments but maybe for other references.

For repetitive checking of gender and certify, it can 
be separated to another method, and just merge the return ed results to the data.

It is also not advisable to use nested 
if else if as it not managable except for certain conditions.
